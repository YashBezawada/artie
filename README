Artie GEANT Simulation

Based on examples/extended/hadronic/Hadr04 (See README.hadr04)


--Forking and cloning--

Have a git account, with an SSH key for the node you are working on.

While logged in to your git account, from here:
   https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie
click the Fork button and follow instructions to fork into your own repository.

From within your own forked repository, click the Clone or Download / SSH button to find the address of the repository, e.g. in my case:

   git@github.com:mulhearn/artie.git

Now from your node, you would do (e.g. in my case):

> git clone git@github.com:mulhearn/artie.git

We'll be staying current with the original repository of Jingbo, so you should also 

> git remote add upstream https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie.git
> git remote -v

You'll see origin (your fork) and upstream (main repository of Jingbo)

--Compilation on DUNE GPVM (13 and higher)--

> source ./setup/dunegpvm.csh
> make 
> ./bin/Linux-g++/Artie run_short.mac 

--Keeping up to date and making a PR--

For simplicity, let's assume you will do your own work on branch master, and have committed your most recent changes via:

git commit -m "my awesome changes"

And you would like to make a PR to make your changes available for everyone.

First make sure you are upto date with upstream:

> git fetch upstream
> git merge upstream/master

If no one else is working, you will see "Already up to date."  If not,
don't panic, this is totally normal, and really the whole purpose for
git, so just resolve conflicts as needed (See:
https://help.github.com/en/articles/addressing-merge-conflicts)

Repeat as needed until you get "Already up to date."

Now update your own repository directly with:

> git push origin master

I like to make a specific PR-branch, so I can press on with my work as usual on master while the PR is being handled, so I also do:

> git push origin master:pr-ADD-SHORT-DESCRIPTION

when I am ready to make a PR.  To make the PR, on the github website, switch to this branch in your repository, and click the New Pull Request button.  Add a description and submit!




--Alternative: Running on your laptop -- (Jingbo Wang, Sep 4, 2019)

-- ROOT and GEANT4 installations -- 

You need need to install ROOT and GEANT4. Follow the instructions below: 

https://root.cern.ch/building-root
http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/InstallationGuide/html/

I use ROOT5.34, but ROOT6 should work as well. My GEANT4 version is geant4.10.03. 

-- setup ROOT and GEANT4 --

source Path-to-your-ROOT/bin/thisroot.sh
source Path-to-your-GEANT4-install/bin/geant4.sh

-- Download the ARTIE code --

The main repository is https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie

While logged in to your git account, from here:
   https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie
click the Fork button and follow instructions to fork into your own repository.

Clice your forked repository. From the "clone or download" button, you will see the address of your repository. 

Now download your own repository with: 

> git clone YourRepositoryAddress

For example, > git clone git@github.com:wangjingbo04/artie.git # UseSSH
or >git clone https://github.com/wangjingbo04/artie.git # UseHttps

-- Compilation on your laptop --

Now you will see the source folder called artie on your laptop. 

create a build folder for the code with:

> mkdir artie_build

Now go to the build folder

> cd artie_build

Run command: 

> cmake -DGeant4_DIR=Path-to-your-GEANT4-install/lib/Geant4-10.3.0/ ../artie
> make -j 4

Run ARTIE simulation in visualization mode: 

> ./Artie

Your GEANT4 has to be installed with OpenGL and Qt4 package. If you don't have OpenGL or Qt4, go back to the GEANT4 installation guidance. 

Run ARTIE in batch mode: 
Copy the macro files with command: 

> cp ../artie/run_argon.mac .
> cp ../artie/run_vacuum.mac .

Copy the MCNP ROOT file from the source folder. This file includes the beam neutron spectrum and the moderator response function

> cp ../artie/data/resolution13a.root .

Then do: 

> ./Artie run_argon.mac
> ./Artie run_vacuum.mac

-- Analysis with ROOT macros --

See artie/macro/README

-- Keeping up to date and making a PR --

See Mike's instruction above. We prefer to do the development on our own folked repository and then make a pull request to the main repository.

Please let me know if you have any trouble running the code on your laptop (my email: jiowang@ucdavis.edu)
